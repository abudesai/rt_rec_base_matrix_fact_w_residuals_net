This is a Recommender System that uses matrix factorization implemented through Tensorflow.

The recommender starts by trying to find matrices $B,C$ that best represents the user-item rating matrix $A$, where $A = BC$.Matrix factorization reduces the number of features of a dataset by reducing the space dimension from N-dimension to K-dimension.

The recommender also has a non-linear residual layer to model the unexplained variances from the base matrix factorization model.

The recommender is equipped with early stopping: the model would stop training if there is no significant improvement in a perdetermined number of epochs, with default equals 3.

The data preprocessing step includes indexing and standardization. Numerical values (ratings) are also scaled to [0,1] using min-max scaling.

During the model development process, the algorithm was trained and evaluated on a variety of datasets such as jester, anime, book-crossing, modcloth, amazon electronics, and movies.

This Recommender System is written using Python as its programming language. Tensorflow and ScikitLearn is used to implement the main algorithm, evaluate the model, and preprocess the data. Numpy, pandas, and feature_engine are used for the data preprocessing steps. SciKit-Optimize was used to handle the HPT. Flask + Nginx + gunicorn are used to provide web service which includes two endpoints- /ping for health check and /infer for predictions in real time.
